🖥️ Online Examination System

📌 Project Description

The Online Examination System is a Java-based desktop application developed to automate the process of conducting examinations and evaluating student performance. It provides a computerized solution for managing online tests efficiently and accurately.
The system allows users to log in securely, attend multiple-choice examinations, answer questions within a specified time limit, and receive instant results after submission. The project is designed using Java technologies and demonstrates the implementation of real-world software development concepts.
The application uses Java Swing for graphical user interface development, JDBC for database connectivity, and MySQL for storing student, exam, and result data.

🚀 Features

Secure user login authentication
Multiple-choice online examinations
Timer functionality using multithreading
Automatic answer evaluation and score calculation
Instant result generation
Question management system
Database storage using MySQL
User-friendly graphical interface

🧠 Concepts Used

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes and objects are used for modular design
Encapsulation: Data members are protected using private access modifiers and getter/setter methods
Multithreading: Timer functionality is implemented using Java Threads
Exception Handling: Used to handle runtime and database errors efficiently
GUI Programming: Java Swing is used for creating interactive user interfaces
Database Connectivity: JDBC is used to connect Java application with MySQL database
